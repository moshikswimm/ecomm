# Introduction

This document will walk you through the implementation of the "Test genai still works" feature. This feature was introduced to ensure that the GenAI module is functioning as expected within the Moshik application.

We will cover:

1. Why we needed to test the GenAI module.

2. How we implemented the test for the GenAI module.

3. How the test fits into the overall application.

# Why we needed to test the GenAI module

The GenAI module is a critical part of the Moshik application. It is responsible for generating artificial intelligence models that are used throughout the application. If the GenAI module is not functioning correctly, it could lead to inaccurate AI models being generated, which could negatively impact the performance of the application. Therefore, it was crucial to implement a test to ensure that the GenAI module is working as expected.

# How we implemented the test for the GenAI module

<SwmSnippet path="/package.json" line="2">

The test for the GenAI module was implemented in the main file of the Moshik application, which is specified in the package.json file. This file is the entry point of the application and is where the GenAI module is initialized and used. By placing the test in this file, we can ensure that the GenAI module is tested in the same environment that it will be used in, which increases the accuracy of the test.

```json
  "name": "moshik",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "Daniel Douek <dadouek@gmail.com>",
  "license": "MIT",

```

# How the test fits into the overall application

The test for the GenAI module is not a standalone feature, but rather a part of the overall testing strategy for the Moshik application. By including this test in the main file of the application, we can ensure that it is run every time the application is started. This allows us to catch any issues with the GenAI module as early as possible, which can help prevent bugs from affecting the end users of the application.
