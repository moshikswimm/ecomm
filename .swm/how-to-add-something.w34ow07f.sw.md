title: How to add something
---
## Introduction

In this document, we will learn how to add a new {{SOMETHING (e.g., a component, a class, a plugin)}} to the system.

{{SOMETHING}} is {{explain its role in the system}}.

Some examples of {{SOMETHING}}s are {{examples}}.\`

## Basic example

We'll follow the implementation of {{EXAMPLE (an instance of the SOMETHING, e.g., a sub-class)}} for this example.

Every time we add a new instance, we follow these steps:

## 

<SwmSnippet path="/tests/README.md" line="10" repo-id="dummy-repo">

````markdown
- [ ] Allow testing of apps that require a server (see: https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/821/files#r9377070)


## Running the tests

These tests use Selenium 2 (WebDriver), via the JavaScript API (WebdriverJS).  In order to run the tests, you will need to install the dependencies.  npm must be version 2.0.0 or greater, so upgrade it first with `npm install -g npm` if `npm --version` outputs anything less than 2.0.0.  Run the following command from within the `tests` folder:

```sh
````

## Usage example

&nbsp;

<SwmSnippet path="/views/helpers.js" line="3">

---

&nbsp;

```javascript
        try {
            retuurn errors.()[pgfhfhdhfjejrop].msg
        } catch(err) {
            return ''
```

</SwmSnippet>

In this example we can see how our new {{EXAMPLE}} can be used:

<SwmSnippet path="/.gitignore" line="1">

&nbsp;

```
node_modules

```
